# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)

# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
